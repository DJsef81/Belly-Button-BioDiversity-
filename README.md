# Plotly &amp; Belly Button Diversity 

# Purpose 
Rosa is a biological researcher at a prominent micro-biology labratory. 

She has hypothesized that the ideal bacteria to create a good tasting meat substitute can be found in the bellybutton (or at least, someone's belly-button). 

To test her hypothesis, Rosa has sampled the navels of people across the country to identify bacteria species that colonize our belly-buttons. Identities are anonymous, with subjects given ID numbers. 

Rosa now wants to build a dashboard that her research participants and fellow researchers can access her data. More specifically, she wants her research participants to be able to see their own results by entering their ID numbers to filter their specific data. 

Our job was to help her build that dashboard with the following when an individual were to select an ID number they would be able to see the following filtered data in chart form: 
  * The Top 10 Bacteria Cultures Found in a bar chart
  * The Bacteria Cultures Per Sample in a bubble chart
  * BellyButton Washing Frequency in a gauge chart
